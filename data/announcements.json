The University had already scheduled the examinations of all four semesters long back and hence it was extremely difficult to reschedule in the last moment.  Moreover finishing final semester examinations and declaring results in time is the  prime concern of the University now. \r\rThis situation seems to have led to difficulty for a few students especially those who are staying away from their home for their studies.  \rUniversity has noticed this difficulty of the students and will ensure that this aspect will be considered while  scheduling examinations in the future. \r\rStudent representatives had also brought to the notice of the  Honourable Minister the difficulty they experienced due the present examination schedule. The Minister considered the request favourably and directed the University to take into account the hardship caused to the students while scheduling examinations in the future. ",

Persistent attacks on such complex networked systems continue to expose their vulnerabilities. Advanced persistent threats (APT), social engineering attacks, and denial of service attacks exploit software, hardware, socio-cultural, and policy weaknesses. Therefore the design, analysis, development and deployment of trusted systems continue to pose major challenges to the technical, policy and consumer communities. This collaborative workshop between APJ Abdul Kalam Technological University (KTU) and the Stevens Institute of Technology will identify the key R&D, innovation/entrepreneurship, education and training challenges/opportunities presented by current and next generation trusted systems. The workshop program includes keynote talks by high profile thought leaders and interdisciplinary discussions involving government/ industry/academic researchers. Technical presentations will cover state-of-the art innovations in trusted systems and significant gaps. The outcome of this workshop will be a strong working relationship between researchers at KTU and Stevens. It will also forge new larger collaboration opportunities between U.S. and India in the area of research and innovation in trusted systems.",
